-------
1:      Strongly typed OOP language. (Strongly typed: You have to declare datatype of each variable)
2:      Proprietry language developed by Salesforce.com.

1:      Upgraded automatically.
2:      Integrated with the database. (No need to make connections like java, C#, C, C++)
3:      Easy to test.
4:      Multitenant environment. (Reduces Cost)
5:      Code is saved against different versions of force.com API

What are APEX Environments?
---------------------------
There are several environments for developing apex code
1:  We can run apex in a developer org, production org and a sandbox.
2:  We cannot develop in our production org because live users are accessing the system so while
    we are developing it can destabilize our data and corrupt our application.
3:  Instead we do all our development work in sandbox or developer edition.

Different types of  APEX Environments?
--------------------------------------

What are the different types of Development Environment?
--------------------------------------------------------
Production				Can't write code in production 
Development				can write code
Testing		
developer adition/sandbox	can write the code but limitation 


What are Sandboxes types?
-------------------------
full copy sandbox
partial copy sandbox
developer sandbox
developer pro sandbox
===========================================================
there is no testing environment we use sandbox for testing
